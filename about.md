# All About Isaac

### Early Life
Isaac James Crawford was born on July 6th, 2001, in a hospital not too far from his hometown of Eudora, Kansas.
This home, however, would not be known long by the young lad, as at the ripe age of 3 he and his family moved away.
After all, his father, at the time Lt. Col. Bobby Grant Crawford, was an active member of the US Army, and as such
the family never stayed anywhere much longer than a year or two, to the point that each of the children had been born
in a different state (or country, in the eldest's case). But, Isaac would not get to know this on-the-road life, as
their next residence would be Isaac's true hometown: West Point, New York, home of the United States Military Academy.

For the next ten years of his life, Isaac's father worked as a professor of mechanical engineering at the West Point Academy,
eventually being promoted to Colonel when Isaac was 6. Nearly all of Isaac's formative childhood took place at West Point,
where he learned to have a love for games, music, and his unique sense of creativity. In middle school he inherited the
alto saxophone his siblings had played before him, having been inspired to join the band the year before after listening to them.

Outside of West Point, Isaac's family would spend most summers visiting their relatives, who where for the most part all conveniently
located in or around his parents' hometown of Fort Smith, Arkansas. Due to rarely ever seeing his relatives, they usually felt something
like novelties, and it was always a fun trip to embark on, despite the 2-3 day road trip with everyone in the big van.

Soon enough, of course, Isaac's father had reached his limit of years, and retired from the military in May of 2014. This
meant that for the first time in his life, Isaac would have to experience an actual move away from one of the few places
he had called home.

### Adolescence
The family found themselves in Cheshire, CT, with 3 of the 5 children away in college already. Isaac's father began working at
Quinnipiac University, once more as a professor of mechanical engineering, and conveniently in the footsteps of his Army colleague
Lynn Byers, who had retired from the military the year before and made the very same move. Over the next 5 years, Isaac slowly grew
into a knew world of people and places he had never before experienced. In high school, Isaac discovered marching band, and while reluctant
to try it at first, he began to develop a love for it that kept him hooked all throughout high school. It was also during this time
that Isaac began to take German classes, due to a world language requirement the school had. Isaac persisted with this all throughout
high school as well, and even tested out of all of what little German his college offered.

It was during this period that Isaac most seriously began to consider music as a career. By senior year he had picked up multiple
new instruments, including other versions of the saxophone as well as flute, horn, trumpet, and some minor experience with other instruments.
Isaac also took jazz classes all throughout high school, which pushed the limits of his musical abilities, as well as participating in honor
band auditions, though he did not get most of them. Eventually, as senior year came to an end, Isaac had applied to a number of music schools,
yet only been accepted to one. On top of this, he would still have to pay half of the tuition, which was not cheap, leaving only one frugal option
left; to attend Quinnipiac, where his father worked, which didn't have a music degree program.

### College

Disheartened by the current outcome of things, but never one to give up, Isaac decided that he would go to Quinnipiac and pursue engineering like
his father and brothers had done before him. He did not abandon music, however, instead determining in his heart that once he had finished his degree
here, that he would eventually go on to pursue music education. Being something of a video game nerd, Isaac opted to study Software Engineering and learn
to program. He bolstered his interests through drawing comparisons to his deeper passion; "After all, both engineering and music are combinations of art
and mathematics, just in different ways", or, "learning different programming languages is much like learning new instruments, or actual languages".
 Reassuring himself with comparisons like these, Isaac entered into his college studies with an open heart and eyes set on the future

### Now

Isaac is currently studying Software Engineering at Quinnipiac University, with minors in both Mathematics and Music. He is also a member of the
university's Honors Program, and was recently elected the President of the Quinnipiac Computing Club, a chapter of the ACM. He will continue his studies for
another 2 years before graduating in 2023 with his Bachelor's degree.
